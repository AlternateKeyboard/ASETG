# ASETG Keyboard Layout

Here's the keyboard layout:

    QWDF KJ UPL;
    ASET GH NIOR
    ZXCV BY M,./


## What is this?

ASETG is a minimal change alternate keyboard layout. Most letters stay on the same fingers with an up-down switch, only 3 letters change fingers. 

This brings the common letters to the home row, and moves the less common letters to the top row. This would be easy to adopt and most muscle memory remains in place. 

The base of this is ASERT, but there is a very good opportunity for improvement. The not frequent P gives an opportunity to move a more frequent letter there. By moving the R this gets both T and R under a finger, balances the hands out, unloads the left index finger, and even keeps G in original spot (interestingly giving a total number of changes of 14, compared to 15). Of course this breaks ERT, muscle memory, and 2 letters change hands and 1 more changes fingers. It’s more “optimized” and in the realm of getting the very common T under a finger with minimal changes it's the best option.
 
Instead of just exchanging R and P, adding the infrequent K is an easy and worthwhile addition. This puts P a much better spot on the strong middle finger, and puts the infrequent K on a worse spot - instead of vice-versa. Once you’re used to the home row, you realize it’s a stretch to qwerty T. Also since K is infrequent it has far fewer bigrams to relearn, so it’s a relatively small addition. At the point of exchanging letters between hands, it’s also better to exchange R for K, rather than P, to better balance the hands and fingers.

To use the concepts above, ASETG is 20% of the pain, for a whopping 80% of the gain.
